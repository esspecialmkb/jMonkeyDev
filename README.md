# jMonkeyDev

As time moves forward, I'm going to keep a few note-worthy proof of concept demos and test releases of my java code for jMonkeyEngine. At this time, I'm officially working on a first-person dungeon/zombie style shooter. I also have plans for a simple dungeon crawler and rudimentary racing game as well. Most of the code at home is dirty and not commented well, so as I clean them up, I will post them here.
